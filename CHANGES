for f90cache-0.95:
--------------------

* previous version already works for some new compiler versions.
  So, updated :
    FSF_G95 : 0.91 to 0.94
    INTEL_IFC : 9 to 13
    OPEN64_F95 : 4.2 to 4.5
    SUN_F95 : 8.5 or 8.6

* IBM XLF support is removed

* GNU_GFC:
    tests have been added (f90cache_driver routine) to check that GNU
    version is between 4.3 and 4.9

    The 4.9 module file are gzipped (without MD5sum embedded); as a result
    the whole compressed module files are added "as is" to the hash.

for f90cache-0.94:
--------------------

* fix "hash_module_file": for GNU-gfortran the search for the "MD5:" tag
  failed for some MOD files. Now, this tag is searched from the first
  char. Via this fix, version 4.7 and 4.8 can be used.

for f90cache-0.93:
--------------------

* fix new web address: http://people.irisa.fr/Edouard.Canot

* GNU-gfortran now uses 'cpp' for preprocessing (instead of the compiler
  name). This avoids the creation of an empty file with a ".s" extension
  in the working directory.

* IBM-xlf95 12 is now supported.

* many few bugs fixed.

* stats for module files is now better handled.

  [upgraded version number to 0.93.1]

* bug fixed in args.c: 'memmove' in 'args_strip' must concern
  (args->argc - i) items, instead of (args->argc) items.

  same fix has been done in 'args_strip_2'

  [upgraded version number to 0.93.2]

* bug fixed in f90cache.c: in 'from_cache', removed the line
    free(output_obj);
  because it is already freed, as an arg of 'orig_args'.
  (this bug lead to an abort in glibc)

  [upgraded version number to 0.93.3]

* OPEN64-openf95 4.2 is now supported.

  [upgraded version number to 0.93.4]

* fix for IBM-xlf95: '-qnostrictieeemod' use leads to a warning.

  [upgraded version number to 0.93.5]

* adding 'break' after some 'for' loops about processing options
  for preprocessing.

* fix a bug at line 247 of f90cache.c: special case for OPEN64_F95
  misses (as for INTEL_IFC), because module option '-module' needs
  a blank after (two args instead of one only)

* adding SOLARIS Studio 12 Fortran 95 (f95 8.5)

  [upgraded version number to 0.93.6]

* applied patch proposed by Elias Pipping
  mail (Date: Fri, 10 Jun 2011 16:07:52 +0200):
    '0001-Only-free-what-was-actually-allocated.patch'

  [upgraded version number to 0.93.7]

for f90cache-0.92:
--------------------

* for FSF-g95, '-pipe' doesn't contribute to the hash name, so it has
  been removed in the 'find_hash' routine.

* fix a bug in to_cache, when compilation failed, we forgot to test
  mod_file_only before trying to check output_obj.

* now, f90cache can put precompiled module files in location
  specified by some compiler-dependant flags (as, e.g., '-fmod=' for
  FSF-g95).

* 'f90cache -C' now remove directories which end with '.dir'
  (previously created to contain one precompiled module file)

* fixed an error in 'wipe_all' (cleanup.c): 'traverse()' must be applied
  to 'dname', not to 'dir' ! else, we do many times the same job !

* fixed an error of ccache, in 'args_strip':
  line: 'args->argc--;' was missplaced !

* add another version of 'args_strip', named, 'args_strip_2', which
  remove two args at a time. Fixed an error when using
  '--f90cache-depmod' with a 'failed' status got in 'process_args'.


for f90cache-0.91:
--------------------

* fixed a strange behavior with INTEL-ifort if we use the '-openmp'
  during compilation, without specifying the destination file: an
  object file named 'penmp' is created!
  From now, a space is required for the '-o dest' option.
  (fix made in f90cache.c)

* added test for compiler detection

========================================================================

from ccache-2.4: creation of the directory f90cache-0.9 in order
to support Fortran 90 (at least gfortran from GCC)

* 'ccache' in all the filenames has been replaced with 'f90cache'

* 'ccache' in all the files has been replaced with 'f90cache'

* 'CCACHE' in all the files has been replaced with 'F90CACHE'

* 'F90CACHE_CC' in all the files has been replaced with 'F90CACHE_FC'

* f90cache.c modification

    static struct extensions[]:
      only the following extensions are valid: .F, .f, .F90, .f90

    routine usage() has been updated

    routine 'f90cache_main()' renamed 'f90cache_command()'

    routine 'f90cache()' renamed 'f90cache_driver()'

    suppression of routine 'setup_uncached_err()' [required for distcc]

* in all files: 'cc_log()' renamed 'fc_log()'

* routine 'unify()' is suppressed (it was for C/C++ only)

* update of routine 'process_args()'

    new list of possible options for gfortran in const char *opts[]

* in routine 'find_hash()'

    the basename is no longer limited to 10 characters
