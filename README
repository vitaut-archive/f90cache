Originally, this program was 'ccache-2.4' from:

  http://samba.org/~tridge/
  bugs@ccache.samba.org

I have modified (and also renamed it to f90cache) it to support Fortran 90.

The first version number I chosen was 0.9 because it is usable.
It is perhaps not yet very stable. More tests must be done.

See also the modifications in the file CHANGES.

Caveats: ccache supports only C/C++ and so, f90cache supports only Fortran 90.
